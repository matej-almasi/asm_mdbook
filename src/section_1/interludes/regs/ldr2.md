# Section 1 / More About `ldr`

## Overview

In this chapter we examine the difference between loading the address of
(a pointer to) a data label versus loading the data at the label. Both
use the `ldr` instruction however, the assembler (on Linux) actually
does some trickery behind the scenes to accomplish the loads.

Note - this chapter describes `ldr` from the perspective of Linux. For a
brief discussion of how Apple Mac OS avoids using `ldr` to load the address
of labels, please [see
here](#apple-silicon) and [below](#apple-silicon).

## Length of Instructions

**All** AARCH64 instructions are 4 bytes in width.

## Length of Pointers

**All** AARCH64 pointers are 8 bytes in width&#8224;.

&#8224;While this is technically true, typically only the lower 39, 42
or 48 bits of addresses in Linux systems are used - i.e. the virtual
address space of an ARM Linux process is smaller than 64 bits. The upper
bits are set to zero when considering the address as an 8-byte value.

## How to Specify an Address Too Big to Fit in an Instruction?

The title of this section sets the table for the need for trickery. All
labels refer to addresses. Addresses are 8 bytes&#8224; in width but all
instructions are 4 bytes in width. Clearly, we cannot fit the full
address of a label in an instruction.

Some ISAs (not ARM) have variable length instructions. The instruction
may be four bytes wide but it tells the CPU that the next eight bytes
are an operand of the instruction. Thus the true instruction width is 12
bytes. This is not true of the ARM ISA.

**All instructions are 4 bytes wide. All of them.**

## "`ldr` x_register, =label" is a Pseudo Instruction

When you assemble an instruction looking like:

```text
    ldr     x1, =label
```

the assembler puts the address of the label into a special region of
memory called a "literal pool." What matters is this region of
memory is placed immediately after (therefore nearby) your code.

Then, the assembler computes the difference between the address of the
current instruction (the `ldr` itself) and the address of the data in
the literal pool made from the labeled data.

The assembler generates a different `ldr` instruction which uses the
difference (or offset) of the data relative to the program counter
(`pc`). The `pc` is non-other the address of the current instruction.

Because the literal pool for your code is located nearby your code, the
offset from the current instruction to the data in the pool is a
relatively **small** number. Small enough, to fit inside a four byte
`ldr` instruction.

```text
    ldr    x1, [pc, offset to data in literal pool]
```

## Example Program for Demonstrating Use of Literal Pool

[Here](./ldr_tests.s) is a sample program demonstrating the difference
between:

```text
    ldr    x1, =q
```

and

```text
    ldr     x1, q
```

Note the difference is that the first has an `=` sign before the label
and the second does not.

Also note, that when `line 15` is executed, the program will **crash**.

```text
        .global     main                                                        // 1 
        .text                                                                   // 2

Disassembling the binary machine code of the executable generated with the
above source code will include:

```text
0000000000007a0 <main>:
 7a0:   f81f0ffe   str  x30, [sp, #-16]!
 7a4:   58000160   ldr  x0, 7d0 <main+0x30>
 7a8:   58000181   ldr  x1, 7d8 <main+0x38>
 7ac:   f9400022   ldr  x2, [x1]
 7b0:   97ffffb4   bl   680 <printf@plt>
 7b4:   580000e0   ldr  x0, 7d0 <main+0x30>
 7b8:   580842c1   ldr  x1, 11010 <q>
 7bc:   f9400022   ldr  x2, [x1]
 7c0:   97ffffb0   bl   680 <printf@plt>
 7c4:   f84107fe   ldr  x30, [sp], #16
 7c8:   2a1f03e0   mov  w0, wzr
 7cc:   d65f03c0   ret
```

and

```text
000000000011010 <q>:
   11010:   55667788
   11014:   11223344
```

Let's examine the second snippet first.

It says `000000000011010 <q>:`. This means that what comes next is the
data corresponding to what is labeled `q` in our source code. Notice the
relocatable address of `11010`. We will explain "relocatable address"
below.

Now, look at the disassembled code on the line beginning with `7b8`. It
reads `ldr x1, 11010`. So the disassembled executable is saying "go to
address 11010 and fetch its contents" which are our `1122334455667788`.

This is not the whole story.

## Relocation of Addresses When Executing

None of the addresses we have seen so far are the final addresses that
will be used once the program is actually running. All addresses will be
*relocated*.

One reason for this is a guard against malware. A technique called
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) prevents malware writers
from being able to know ahead where to modify your executable in order
to accomplish their nefarious purposes.

This image shows `gdb` in `layout regs` at the time our program is loaded.

![Prior to Launch](././1_prior_to_running.png)

Notice that all of the addresses match the disassemblies given above.
For example `main()` starts at `7a0`.

Now watch what happens the the program is actually launched (see Figure
2):

![After breakpoint and launch](./2_after_b_and_run.png)

Suddenly all the address change to much larger values.

**In fact, the addresses all seem to be six bytes long!**

Why are these addresses only six bytes long when all pointers are
8 bytes long?

Sixty four bit ARM Linux kernels allocate 39, 42 or 48 bits for the size
of a process's virtual address space. Notice 42 and 48 bit values
require 6 bytes to hold them. A virtual address space is all of the
addresses a process can generate / use. Further, all addresses used
by processes are virtual addresses.

Kernels supporting other VA spaces, including 52 bit address spaces
are possible but less common.

The salient point is that even six bytes is far too large to fit in a
four byte instruction. GDB is masking the pseudo instruction and showing
what the effective addresses are.**

Now lets step forward to see the results of the first `ldr` of the
`printf()` template / format string into `x0`. See Figure 3.

![Results of first ldr](./3_results_of_first_ldr.png)

There is a pointer in `x0` ending in `b018`. Notice this is **NOT**
the value encoded in the instruction ending in `a7d0`.
This is our only indirect evidence that the instruction we wrote
has been modified to use some calculated offset from the `pc`.

To finish, here is how we confirm `x0` is indeed correct. See Figure 4.

![Confirming x0](./4_confirm_x0_is_correct.png)

Notice down below the `x/s $x0` prints the value in memory
corresponding to the address contained in `x0`.

Finally see Figure 5.

![Confirming x2](./5_confirm_x2_is_correct.png)

At the outset of this discussion we said that this program will crash on
source code `line 15`. See if you can work out why. Take a moment before
reading further.

Now that you have a hypothesis in mind, take a look at this screenshot
showing the state of `x1` after this instruction: `ldr  x1, q` is
executed. See Figure 6.

![After bad load](./after_bad_load.png)

Notice that what is in `x1` this time looks very different from the
previous attempt at printing. Notice still more that the value now in
`x1` is the value of `q`, not its address.

Naturally, the next instruction which tries to dereference the value of
`q` rather than its address, causes a crash. See Figure 7.

![After crash](./after_crash.png)

## Summary

We have learned how the addresses corresponding to labels
can be found. We also have learned how the contents of
memory at those labels can be retrieved.

| Instruction | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- |
| ldr r, =label | Load the address of the label into r |
| ldr r, label | Load the value found at the label into r |

In both cases, the assembler will likely do some magical translation of
your simple `ldr` instruction into something involving offsets so that
the resulting offset can fit into an instruction where the full address
cannot.

To store a value back to memory at the address given by a label, the
address corresponding to the label will have first been loaded as is
described above. Then, once the address is in a register, an `str`
instruction can be used to properly locate the values to be written.

## Questions

To be written.

## Apple Silicon

You've seen that under Linux, there is a pseudo-instruction which hides
some trickery:

`ldr    x0, =label`

This works if `label` is +/- four mebibytes (as megabytes are now
called) away from the `ldr` instruction.

*A downside of this approach is that the literal pool, from which the
address is loaded, resides in RAM. This means each of these `ldr`
pseudo instructions incurs a memory reference.*

Apple "thinks different." The above instruction will not pass the
assembler on a Mac OS machine. Instead, Apple uses two techniques
which can access labels no matter where they are *without incurring
a reference to memory*.

Apple accomplishes this by splitting the loading of the address of a
label into two instructions. The first causes the base address of the
*page* on which the label resides to be loaded. The page number is
calculated for you based upon the label. The second adds to the base
address, the offset in the page at which the label can be found.

Both of these values are computed at build time and therefore do not
need to reference memory. This is a good thing.

Here is how one would load the address of a label which is outside the
source code module:

```text
.macro  GLD_ADDR    xreg, label     // Get a global address
#if defined(__APPLE__)
        adrp        \xreg, _\label@GOTPAGE
        add         \xreg, \xreg, _\label@GOTPAGEOFF
#else
        ldr         \xreg, =\label
#endif
.endm
```

This is a macro from our [Apple Linux Convergence
Suite](../../macros/README.md).

It shows how, on Apple systems, the higher bits of the address is loaded
from the starting address of the page on which the symbol sits and then
the remainder (the offset) is added in.

The `G` in `GLD_ADDR` stands for global.

If the label is defined in the same source code module:

```asm
.macro  LLD_ADDR xreg, label
#if defined(__APPLE__)
        adrp        \xreg, \label@PAGE
        add         \xreg, \xreg, \label@PAGEOFF
#else
        ldr         \xreg, =\label
#endif
.endm
```

The difference being `@PAGE` versus `@GOTPAGE`, etc.

The first `L` in `LLD_ADDR` stands for local.

## Avoiding the Memory Reference on Linux

The technique Apple uses for loading the address of labels can be used
on Linux as well so as to avoid the reference to memory (literal pool).

Suppose `s` is a locally defined symbol. Then:

```asm
adrp    x0, s
add     x0, x0, :lo12:s
```

duplicates the approach Apple uses.
