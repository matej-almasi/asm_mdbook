# Section 1 / `const`

In C++, a variable declared to be const cannot be altered.
This concept only *partially* translates to assembly language
in a manner which is enforced by the hardware. The remainder
of the functionality of `const` is enforced at compile time
and therefore, at the assembly language level, all bets are
off.

## What Is **Not** Enforced

Given [this](./const_test.cpp) short C++ snippet:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>                                                      // 1 
                                                                        // 2 
void Const1() {                                                         // 3 
    const int foo = 9;                                                  // 4 
    printf("%d\n", foo);                                                // 5 
}                                                                       // 6
```

it is the C++ compiler that enforces the immutable nature of `foo`.
Looking at the assembly language that is produced from this C++ code,
you will [see](./const_test.s) that `foo` is implemented like any other
variable. Once in assembly language you are behind the defenses of the
compiler so to speak. You can modify a `const` local variable or
parameter to your heart's content. Should you? That's another question.
Will it cause harm? It depends.

## What **IS** Enforced

Let's examine [this](./rodata.s) code:

```text
        .global        main                                             // 1 
        .align        2                                                 // 2 
                                                                        // 3 
        .section    .rodata                                             // 4 
rotypo: .asciz      "Rypo"          // Meant this to be "Typo"          // 5 
fmt:    .asciz      "%s\n"          // Used to print the strings        // 6 
                                                                        // 7 
        .data                                                           // 8 
rwtypo: .asciz      "Rypo"          // Meant this to be "Typo"          // 9 
                                                                        // 10 
        .text                                                           // 11 
                                                                        // 12 
main:   str         x30, [sp, -16]!                                     // 13 
        // Try to fix rwtypo --- this will work                         // 14 
        ldr         x1, =rwtypo                                         // 15 
        mov         w2, 'T'                                             // 16 
        strb        w2, [x1]                                            // 17 
        ldr         x0, =fmt        // Notice I already loaded rwtypo   // 18 
        bl          printf                                              // 19 
                                                                        // 20 
        // Try to fix rotypo --- this will end in tears                 // 21 
        ldr         x1, =rotypo                                         // 22 
        mov         w2, 'T'                                             // 23 
        strb        w2, [x1]                                            // 24 
        ldr         x0, =fmt        // Notice I already loaded rotypo   // 25 
        bl          printf                                              // 26 
                                                                        // 27 
        ldr         x30, [sp], 16                                       // 28 
        mov         w0, wzr                                             // 29 
        ret                                                             // 30 
                                                                        // 31 
        .end                                                            // 32 
                                                                        // 33 
```

In this example, we are declaring a `const` *global variable*.

Notice `.section .rodata`. This assembler directive tells the linker to place
what follows into memory that will be marked as read only. Any attempt to
modify something marked as read only by the hardware will result in a crash.

`rwtypo` can be read and written as it is located after a `.data`. The
string contains a typo - we meant to write "Typo" but we experienced a
senior moment and what got entered was "Rypo". Could happen to anyone.

For some reason, we will fix "Rypo", turning it into "Typo" using code
rather than simply editing the file.

The same is true for `rotypo`. Extra credit for being consistent.

However,
`rotypo` is going to live in a region of memory marked as read only
at the hardware level because it is defined after a `.section .rodata`.

Will we be able to correct it using code?

tl;dr Nope.

This program, when run, will produce the following output:

```text
const > ./a.out
Typo
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
const >
```

This demonstrates that the first attempt at modifying `rwtypo` worked. And
then, an attempt to modify `rotypo` causes a segmentation fault.

## Summary

The meaning and function of `const` only partially translates
to assembly language. `const` local variables and `const`
parameters are just like any other data to assembly language.
The constant nature of `const` local variables and parameters
is implemented solely in the compiler.

`const` globals are made constant by the hardware. Attempting
to modify a variable protected in this manner will be like
poking a dragon. Best not to poke dragons.
